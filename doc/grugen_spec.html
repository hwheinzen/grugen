<p>
	This is a reference manual for the Grugen generator.
</p>

<p>
	Grugen is a code generator that produces Go code and puts it into a .go file.
	It generates a function featuring a simple control break logic
	for the processing of grouped (sorted) input data.
	It integrates code snippets provided by the programmer.
	The generated Go code can be integrated in a Go project.
	It is possible to integrate the code generation into the project's workflow
	via 'go generate'.
</p>
<p>
	Programmers then can use a function with the following signature:
</p>

<pre>
func conbreak(in *bufio.Reader, out *bufio.Writer) error
</pre>

<p>
	Grugen takes a specification file &mdash; we will call it Grugen file &mdash;
	as its input. 
</p>
<p>
	The Grugen file consists of instructions to the generator
	and Go code snippets provided by the programmer.
	Its grammar is compact and regular.
</p>

<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>
The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
</pre>

<p>
Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following
operators, in increasing precedence:
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
</pre>

<p>
	Lexical tokens are enclosed in double quotes "".
</p>

<h2>Grugen file</h2>

<p>
	The Grugen file controls the Grugen generator. It will be processes line by line.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
grugen_file  = { comment_line } gru_definition { select_location | comment_line | code_line } .
comment_line = ".*" [ any_comment ]                                                      "\n" .
code_line    = /* any line that does not start with "." in column 1 */                   "\n" .
</pre>

<p>
	Instructions for Grugen start with a "." in column 1.
	Comment lines will be ignored. Code lines go straight into the generated .go file.
</p>
<p>
	<code>code_line</code> should contain valid Go code.
</p>


<h2>Definition of groups</h2>

<pre class="grammar">
gru_definition = file_level { group_level | comment_line } record_level .
file_level     = ".gru-" file_level_name [ "," line_limit ]        "\n" .
line_limit     = "limit=" [ "'" rune_lit "'" | decimal_digits ] .
group_level    = ".gru-" group_level_name "," type_name            "\n" .
record_level   = ".gru-" record_level_name [ "," type_name ]       "\n" .
</pre>

<p>
	All names, i.e <code>file_level_name</code> etc., must be unique, and valid Go identifiers as specified in "The Go Programming Language Specification"; <code>rune_lit</code> and <code>decimal_digits</code> are also specified there.
</p>
<p>
	File, group, and record level names and type names on group level
	are being used to generate variables that control the control break logic.
</p>
<p>
	The first .gru statement defines the file level. 
	<code>file_level_name</code> becomes part of location names. 
	<code>line_limit</code> tells Grugen what a <i>line</i> is: 
	a line is either limited by a rune (default is the newline rune '\n')
	or it is defined by a fixed lenght in number of bytes.
</p>
<p>
	The last .gru statement defines the record level. 
	<code>record_level_name</code> becomes part of a location name.
	<code>type_name</code> is used to generate a variable which is meant
	to hold data on record level.
</p>
<p>
	At least <code>file_level</code> and <code>record_level</code> must be declared.
</p>
<p>
	Arbitrary group levels are possible. 
	<code>file_level_name</code> becomes part of location names. 
	<code>type_name</code> is the type of the group key;
	any type other than a standard type must be declared in the 'global' location.
</p>
<p>
	N.B.: At least two statements starting with ".gru-" are expected:
	<code>file_level</code> and <code>record_level</code>
</p>


<h2>Selecting locations</h2>

<p>
	<i>Locations</i> are places in the generated Go code known to Grugen.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
select_location = ".sl=" location_name .
location_name   = package_statement | import | global |state | get |
                  "o_" file_level_name | "c_" file_level_name |
                  "o_" group_level_name | "c_" group_level_name |
                  "p_" record_level_name .
</pre>

<p>
	With <code>select_location</code> a location becomes <i>active</i> and Grugen
	puts any following <code>code_line</code> into that location until another location will be activated by a new <code>select_location</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Location <code>package_statement</code> has to be used if the generated code
	is to be incorporated in a package other than </code>main</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Location <code>import</code> has to be used if a package is used
	which is not yet part of the import statement.
</p>
<p>
	Location <code>global</code> is meant for all necessary
	Go file scope declarations.
</p>
<p>
	Location <code>state</code> is part of the reading routine 
	directly after a successful read; the string variable 'line' contains the data. Here it is possible to repeat the read operation with a "goto readagain".
</p>
<p>
	At location <code>get</code> the programmer has to use the content of 
	the string variable 'line' and fill all the variables named after the 
	<code>&lt;group_level_name&gt;Key</code> and <code>&lt;record_level_name&gt;Key</code>.
</p>


<h2>The processing locations</h2>

<p>
	In the following locations you have variables at your disposal that are named
	<code>group_level_name</code> and <code>record_level_name</code>. 
	These variables contain the current group keys and the detailed record data.
</p>
<p>
	For the file level and for every group level there is 
	1) an 'o_' location ('o' for 'open processing') for Go code to be executed at the beginning of file or a group respectively and 
	2) a 'c_' location ('c' for 'close processing') for Go code to be executed at the end of file or end of a group respectively.
</p>
<p>
	For the record level there is a 'p_' location ('p' for 'processing') for Go code to be executed after each record has been read.
</p>
